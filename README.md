Expense Tracker---A Java Console application

According to the requirements I have created a Expense Tracker that allows the users to:
1.Add Income and expense
2.categorized transactions like salary, rent, food, travel
3.save and load transactions using CSV file
4.view monthly summaries of income, expenses and balances

-->open the project in eclipse
-->run it
--> In project I have used switch case where there will be having 6 options
1.Add income
2.Add expense
3.view monthly summary
4.load from file
5.save to file
6.exit
-->If user clicks income (option 1) and saves it using (option 5) then the information will be saved in transactions.csv file which I have created in eclipse file
